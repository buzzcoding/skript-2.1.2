# skript-legacy
An old version of Skript for 1.8 Minecraft servers.<br><br>
**NOTE: I recommend updating your server. 1.8 is almost 7 years old now, and you can just use a plugin like OldCombatMechanics for 1.8 combat. Also, these versions will not have the latest features of Skript and are not likely to support many addons. You may also rather use 2.2-dev36 (https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/tag/dev36), which may less stable, but is 4 years more up-to-date.**<br><br>

Here is what the developers of Skript said:<br>
*“For Minecraft 1.8 and older, you'll have to try older release. Skript 2.1.2 is probably the most stable, but old development releases like 2.2-dev36 might also work. We support neither and recommend that you upgrade to Minecraft 1.9.4 or newer version.”*
